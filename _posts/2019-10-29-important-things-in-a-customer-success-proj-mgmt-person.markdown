Qualities that are important for someone doing customer relations:

Implementation experience

They have taken software from idea to implementation & use in real life. Examples of this: 

I set up a wiki for my coworkers. 

I project-managed the deployment of a new student information system at a small college

I managed the donation pipeline from web form to CRM for a nonprofit

Tech-adjacency is key.



Attention to detail & design

I think it would be good to have someone else with "design-thinking" on the team. Maybe they're a daily Dribbble reader. Maybe they're enthusiastic abut 99% Invisible. 



"Yes, if..."

Put them in a case study where a client has unrealistic demands. Does the person say "no, we can't do that"? See if they can artfully say "yes, anything's possible, if....". Focus on their prioritization skills and ability to communicate alternative solutions.



"Why do you come to work?"

This person's answer should be "for the customers". Be a customer advocate, so there's urgency and deadlines are real around getting things to customers.

But I took a class once where they asked an interesting question and that is: Why do you go to work?



And they gave five answers, I have changed it to six, and the six are: 1: for the paycheck, 2: for something interesting to do, 3: for your coworkers, so that you have others that you like to be with and work with, 4: for your customer to meet the commitments to your customer, 5: for the competition, if you think that’s challenging and fun, 6: for the mission. And then they asked us to put a percent by each one. We were all in different industries, we weren’t all in health care, or IT, they asked us to put a percent by each one.



It’s interesting, if you were to do each thing and they said circle the one with the largest percent and if there are ties, pick one. And what do you think I put down?



Katelyn Ferral: Customer?



Faulkner: Yes. And my feeling is if we take good care of our customers, they take good care of the patients and our job is to help the customers take good care of the patients. So it’s indirect. Yes, of course we want to help patients but the best way we can help them is to help the customers.



What's the ideal frequency to talk to customers?

Ask them this question.
