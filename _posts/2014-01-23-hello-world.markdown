## A First Toast ##

By which, I clearly meant post. I'm now using GitHub pages to serve my blog. Before, it was on a Wordpress site hosted on a laptop in my bedroom.

I'm using a theme engine called *Octopress*. There's a link in the footer. It's a neat little static site generator. Posts are created in markdown (something else I'm trying for the first time), and a ruby Rake (still not sure what that means) file takes the markdown, along with the theme's SASS, and generates a static site which is committed to the GitHub pages repository.

I spent about 30 minutes installing and configuring Octopress, and another 2 hours trying to figure out how themes work.

* List element 2

Anyway, here's where I'll be keeping track of the fun stuff I come across while learning (mostly) Python and other programming.
