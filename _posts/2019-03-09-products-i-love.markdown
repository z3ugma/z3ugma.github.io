We are in the middle of a "stuff" revolution.

The success of Mario Kondo's book _The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up_ and its Netflix successor _Tidying Up_ speaks to what earlier books like _Stuffocation_ have realized about our era: most of us have too much crap.

I fit neatly into the generational shift towards preferring experiences over things, but I'm also a hobbyist with a short attention span. Any time I take on a new hobby, I accumulate the associated stuff. And very occasionally, that stuff doesn't make me feel "stuffocated" - it sparks joy, if you will.

If you're into the same weird combination of stuff as me, and also feel like you have too much crap, give these things a try. Hopefully they'll bring you joy too.

I find it easiest to explain why I love this spatula so much by considering the variety of tasks that we put a spatula through: it's a tool that needs to be flexible enough to conform to the edges of a container, but sturdy enough to scrape away stuck-on bits. It needs to be wide enough to flip an omelet but narrow enough to fit into a jam jar. It should never scratch the coating of a pan, but never get melted from the heat. It should be able to get tossed in the dishwasher but not leave food residue trapped inside it.

This spatula nails all of these, which alone make it the best spatula I've ever owned, but that's not what sparks joy about it. 

It's the heavy stainless-steel handle.

Like a good knife that is balanced to require only the tiniest effort from a cook, this spatula considers the ergonomic of its use. The heft of the handle helps press the spatula into the bowl so you don't have to use a ton of force to scrape the sides. It can rest on the edge of a cutting board without tipping over the edge of the counter. And it's removable, so you can thoroughly wash the joint between the head and the handle. 

You can get one here, and help a charity through Amazon Smile:
