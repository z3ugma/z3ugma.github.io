Next up, a departure from my usual programming entries to another hobby - cooking.

It's [Veganuary](http://www.veganuary.com)! It's a month of sacrifice for me, in the name of shedding holiday pounds.

The single hardest thing for me about going vegan is finding quick meals to make that aren't a piece of fruit. 

I think it's similar to when I stopped eating meat. At first, I started cooking the same old meals, just with the meat removed and a vegetable or mushrooms substituted. These sometimes felt lacking. Over time, I learned to cook "natively veggie" meals - meals that were vegetarian from the start, whose flavors melded and combined deliciously without the need for meat.

Now that I'm not eating dairy or cheese, I find my usual meals lacking - because there's no dairy or cheese. It will take some time to learn to cook "natively vegan", I'm sure.

In the meantime, however, here's an amazing, hearty, breakfast, that's totally vegan.

# Vegan Biscuits and Gravy #

_Serves 4_

## Ingredients ##

- 12 oz Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced
- 1 green bell pepper, diced
- 2 oz Earth Balance buttery vegan spread
- 2 oz whole wheat flour
- 1 Tbsp Better than Bouillon No-Beef Base
- Garlic Naan or vegan english muffins

## Directions ##
1. With a little olive oil, brown the chorizo, onions, and peppers in a large skillet. Once browned, move the mixture to one half of the pan.
2. Melt the earth balance in the empty half of the pan. Add the flour and whisk lightly until a pasty consistency is achieved. Allow this roux to brown for a minute.
3. Mix bouillon and 1 cup of water. Add to the roux a little bit at a time, whisking constantly until gravy-like. Mix the chorizo mixture in with the broth. Add water to thin to your liking.
4. Toast the garlic naan or english muffin. Slice into thin wafers and top the bread with biscuits and gravy. Yum!
