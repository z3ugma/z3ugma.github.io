In six and a half years at Epic, work has taken me to just about every corner of the United States. I have spent 600 days, over a quarter of my working days, visiting hospitals. I do that so I can learn about the people that work there and why they run their practice a certain way. In rural Pennsylvania, telemedicine and weekend clinics are an important way to deliver care to patients that live several hours' drive from a clinic. In the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, people value independence and set pragmatic efficiency goals that they expect their people to meet with few execuses and little oversight.

I have these great stories from all over the country but not its third-largest city that's practically in my backyard. Why do I come to Chicago so rarely?

## Seoul Taco, Hyde Park

The sidewalk sandwich board was tucked inside the entryway. It read "GRAND OPENING" in fresh chalk, belying just how much of a newcomer Seoul Taco is to Hyde Park. Starting as a food truck in St. Louis, Seoul Taco embodies the latest craze of cross-cultural fast casual restaurants bringing foreign flavors to Midwestern palates (Indikitch in NYC is another good one).

They're new enough to not have nailed down the process yet, but give it a couple of weeks and I'm sure it will be smooth sailing. The kimchi has intense heat mingled with effervescent fermentation bubbles - wow, is it intense but delicious.

A corn taco with tofu, spicy mayo, sesame, and scallions gave nice, creamy bites of relief from the heat.

## Pacific Standard Time

Since I'm staying in River North, I was excited to try one of "The 18 Best New Restaurants in America" per Eater magazine, Pacific Standard Time. It's west-coast-y, mediterranean fare. The portions are large; I actually wish they were smaller and cheaper so I could taste more! That's just one of the reasons why coming here as a single diner and sitting at one of the out-of-the-way counters is probably not the best way to experience this huge space. I was neglected for long periods of time by my server, most conspicuously when I had finished and was looking to get the check. A bigger party who shares plates will probably get better service.

When the food and drinks _did_ arrive, they were prettily executed and at the perfect temperature. Unfortunately, the food was not delivered with attention to rhythm. The small crudo appetizer came last, after the hearty pita and smoked eggplant dip.

## Two Lights Seafood Co

_Coromandel oysters; clam chowder; pow bang shrimp; cole slaw_

Old Town is steeped in Chicago history. Sitting inside the long, narrow [Two Lights Seafood Co](https://www.twolightschicago.com/), you can look across the busy street out of the wide, bright plate glass windows at Second City, the comedy club where decades of Saturday Night Live members got their start. Look to your right and find the storied [Old Town Ale House](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/chicago/no-shots-allowed-an-oral-history-of-the-old-town-ale-house), famous as the favorite bar of Roger Ebert, among others. When you walk the residential streets nearby you'll notice fussy Victorian apartments. Here and there, though, they are being replaced by sleek, modern, glass-and-steel two-flats. From my brief stroll, the dining scene looks similarly baroque, but is evolving like the neighborhood: it has a hip, minimalist, honest restaurant in Two Lights Seafood Co. 

The atmosphere is bright and clean with anchors painted on the wall, lofty quotations about the sea, and a bright-white countertop sporting an oyster-shucking station. On this slow Monday night, the staff were jovial and friendly with each other and with patrons and welcomed me with good conversation while they worked. The whimsy in the staff culture carries over to the menu: the design is neat and careful yet it advertises a pickleback shot - which was delicious, by the way.

Oysters come with a choice of sauce - the rhubarb mignonette was especially tasty on the Coromandels offered as the day's West-Coast choice.

The clam chowder was soothing and piping hot, with house-made oyster crackers. 

The pow bang shrimp was the highlight of the meal, though. The shrimp are breaded, fried and tossed in sweet chili sauce. On the side is pickled sushi ginger and the best part - sesame sand. Sesame seeds are ground and the oil is pressed out of them, leaving a powdered and crunchy "sand". When you fork a piece of shrimp, dust it with sesame sand, and roll it in a piece of ginger, you get so many textures and flavors in one bite. - Cool and spicy ginger, gritty and drying sesame, sweet and hot and crunchy from the breading, and finally the tender and springy shrimp. A great dish.

The cole slaw is unique and piquant; no sloppy wilted vegetables in mayonnaise. Bright colors and vegetal flavors of apple, celery root, carrot, and fennel make it a good palate cleanser.
