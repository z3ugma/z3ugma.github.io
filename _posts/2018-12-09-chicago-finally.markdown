In six and a half years at Epic, work has taken me to just about every corner of the United States. I have spent 600 days, over a quarter of my working days, visiting hospitals. I do that so I can learn about the people that work there and why they run their practice a certain way. In rural Pennsylvania, telemedicine and weekend clinics are an important way to deliver care to patients that live several hours' drive from a clinic. In the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, people value independence and set pragmatic efficiency goals that they expect their people to meet with few execuses and little oversight.

I have these great stories from all over the country but not its third-largest city that's practically in my backyard. Why do I come to Chicago so rarely?

## Seoul Taco, Hyde Park

_OG kimchi; single corn taco with tofu_

The sidewalk sandwich board was tucked inside the entryway. It read "GRAND OPENING" in fresh chalk, belying just how much of a newcomer Seoul Taco is to Hyde Park. Starting as a food truck in St. Louis, Seoul Taco embodies the latest craze of cross-cultural fast casual restaurants bringing foreign flavors to Midwestern palates (Indikitch in NYC is another good one).

They're new enough to not have nailed down the process yet, but give it a couple of weeks and I'm sure it will be smooth sailing. The kimchi has intense heat mingled with effervescent fermentation bubbles - wow, is it intense but delicious.

A corn taco with tofu, spicy mayo, sesame, and scallions gave nice, creamy bites of relief from the heat.



## Pacific Standard Time

_aji crudo; avocado & buttermilk salad; warm pita with smoked eggplant and robiniola_

Since I'm staying in River North, I was excited to try one of "The 18 Best New Restaurants in America" per Eater magazine, Pacific Standard Time. It's west-coast-y, mediterranean fare. The portions are large; I actually wish they were smaller and cheaper so I could taste more! That's just one of the reasons why coming here as a single diner and sitting at one of the out-of-the-way counters is probably not the best way to experience this huge space. I was neglected for long periods of time by my server, most conspicuously when I had finished and was looking to get the check. A bigger party who shares plates will probably get better service.



When the food and drinks \_did\_ arrive, they were prettily executed and at the perfect temperature. Unfortunately, the food was not delivered with attention to rhythm. The small crudo appetizer came last, after the hearty pita and smoked eggplant dip.
