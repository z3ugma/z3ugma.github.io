##Sexy Pizza - South Pearl, Denver##

I took a 5K sunset hike in Morrison, CO, today, a solid 20 minutes beyond surburban Denver and into the foothills. Afterwards, I was starving for an uncomplicated meal, and my friend Shauna has been after me to try Sexy Pizza for some time. It was right on the way home, so I stopped in. Pearl Street was unusually quiet so late at night, and I sat near the street in front of the wide-open garage door. An aside - it's very awkward to walk into a restaurant that has a normal door adjacent to an open garage door. Which is the right entrance?

It was nice seeing all the passersby, and the service staff was, like the restaurant, uncomplicated. They let me walk into the back unannounced to get a box at the end of the meal, they didn't bother me needlessly once my order was placed, and carried on lighthearted, boisterous conversation.

I can't express the same happiness for their product. Thick dough goes into a very hot brick-style oven, and the bottom of the crust takes on a Neapolitan crisp. The top of the dough stayed pillowy, however, and it made for a weird texture - too crunchy on the bottom, but underdone near the toppings. I do confess I ordered a lot of watery toppings in the form of a veggie pie, but the weird duality of the texture turned me off. My goal for my time in Denver is to not eat dinner at the same place twice - here's one I won't regret not visiting again.
