  <p>##Sexy Pizza - South Pearl, Denver##</p>

<p>I took a 5K sunset hike in Morrison, CO, today, a solid 20 minutes beyond surburban Denver and into the foothills. Afterwards, I was starving for an uncomplicated meal, and my friend Shauna has been after me to try Sexy Pizza for some time. It was right on the way home, so I stopped in. Pearl Street was unusually quiet so late at night, and I sat near the street in front of the wide-open garage door. An aside - it’s very awkward to walk into a restaurant that has a normal door adjacent to an open garage door. Which is the right entrance?</p>

<p>It was nice seeing all the passersby, and the service staff was, like the restaurant, uncomplicated. They let me walk into the back unannounced to get a box at the end of the meal, they didn’t bother me needlessly once my order was placed, and carried on lighthearted, boisterous conversation.</p>

<p>I can’t express the same happiness for their product. Thick dough goes into a very hot brick-style oven, and the bottom of the crust takes on a Neapolitan crisp. The top of the dough stayed pillowy, however, and it made for a weird texture - too crunchy on the bottom, but underdone near the toppings. I do confess I ordered a lot of watery toppings in the form of a veggie pie, but the weird duality of the texture turned me off. My goal for my time in Denver is to not eat dinner at the same place twice - here’s one I won’t regret not visiting again.</p>
