        Using cURL To Test Exchange Web Services

    <span class="post-date">26 Jan 2014</span>

    <p>From <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/exchangedev/archive/2009/02/05/quick-and-dirty-unix-shell-scripting-with-ews.aspx">this post</a>, I learned how to write a little shell script that uses cURL to check to see if I’m connecting to the Exchange Web Services server correctly. This made testing my Python EWS script easier, especially when I accidentally connected to the wrong WiFi network and couldn’t contact the EWS server.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">curl <span class="nt">-u</span> username@domain:password <span class="nt">-L</span> https://exchange_server/ews/exchange.asmx <span class="nt">-H</span> <span class="s2">"Content-Type:text/xml"</span>    <span class="nt">--ntlm</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will read back the schema from the WSDL file if you’ve successfully connected to the server.</p>

    <h2 id="creating-an-internal-emailing-wikibot-in-python">Creating an Internal Emailing Wikibot in Python</h2>

<p>You know how they say that when all you have is a hammer that everything looks like a nail?</p>

<p>For now, Python is my hammer. I understand that C# or VB would be a better choice for this project, particularly since Microsoft Exchange plays much more nicely with them than Python, but as I’m just starting out I think I’m still in the phase of learning  <em>how the language works</em>, and haven’t quite progressed to learning <em>what the language is good for</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose there’s something to be said for the fact that Python is platform-agnostic.</p>

<p>Here’s a project I’m working on, though: the first end-goal is to:</p>

<p>1.)   Find a random wiki page
2.)   Find its owner
3.)   Email that owner to notify them that page was chosen</p>

<h2 id="part-1-connecting-python-to-exchange-web-services">Part 1: Connecting Python to Exchange Web Services</h2>

<p>Since this is an internal wiki to my company, there is a lot of benefit to using Exchange to send the emails. Most of all that I am rolling it on my own, and not working with the network admins and therefore don’t have access to the SMTP server.</p>

<p>Microsoft Exchange Server has a SOAP API, called Exchange Web Services. This has been a fun experience learning SOAP for the first time.</p>

<p>####What is SOAP?####
SOAP stands for Simple Object Access protocol. It’s an XML-based messaging system that servers and clients can use to talk to each other with standardized messages.  The client understand what XML tags the server uses by getting a file called the WSDL.</p>

<p>I’ll be using a Python SOAP library called Suds  to talk to the Exchange server.</p>

<p>There are a few catches, though. EWS doesn’t play nice with Suds, so we need a few patches and other modules to get it working well.</p>

<h3 id="installing-suds">Installing Suds</h3>

<p>On Mac and Linux, this is trivially easy: run</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>pip <span class="nb">install </span>suds</code></pre></figure>

<p>(If you don’t have pip on your Mac, you can run <a href="https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py">the get-pip</a> installer file.</p>

<p>On Windows, where I did it, this is a little harder, but you can still download an easy_install script and the zip file of Suds.</p>

<p>Then, you boot up a SOAP client with Suds, and I didn’t document this very well, but it returns an HTTP 401 error; Not Authorized.</p>

<h3 id="getting-suds-to-work-with-ews">Getting Suds to Work with EWS</h3>

<p>Hmm. Googling for a few hours brought me to a <a href="http://mail.libexpat.org/pipermail/soap/2011-September/000583.html">good solution, first suggested on the Suds forums</a>.</p>

<p>EWSClient is Daniel Holth’s solution to marrying Suds to EWS.  Installing it will also intall python-ntlm, which will be important later.</p>

<p>The main file in EWSClient is:</p>

        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">ctx</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This adds a plugin to Suds that adds EWS’s definitions to the end of the SOAP request. I don’t quite understand how it works, given Microsoft’s byzantine EWS definitions. At any rate, it works.</p>

<p>EWSClient has a few other files, too, like monkey.py, which fixes an issue where the client makes a request to the often-overloaded W3C definitions for XML. It instead lets you access a locally-cached copy of the file. I disabled it because my Windows python client was causing me a headache.</p>

<p>Using the example files that ewsclient provides, I try to get the WSDL specs:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-python" data-lang="python"><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">ewsclient</span>

<p>The thing to focus on is that we’re authenticating with NTLM, and the auth_header_value s aren’t formatted properly. There are some issues in python-ntlm that need fixing to play nicely with the encoding of domain, user, and pass.</p>

<p>By which, I clearly meant post. I’m now using GitHub pages to serve my blog. Before, it was on a Wordpress site hosted on a laptop in my bedroom.</p>

<p>I’m using a theme engine called <em>Octopress</em>. There’s a link in the footer. It’s a neat little static site generator. Posts are created in markdown (something else I’m trying for the first time), and a ruby Rake (still not sure what that means) file takes the markdown, along with the theme’s SASS, and generates a static site which is committed to the GitHub pages repository.</p>

<p>I spent about 30 minutes installing and configuring Octopress, and another 2 hours trying to figure out how themes work.</p>

        Homebrew Temperature Monitoring
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>A few weeks ago, I embarked on a project to monitor the temperature of my homebrews as they ferment and bottle-age.</p>

<p>###The Data###</p>

<p>In order to record temperatures, I ordered 3 TEMPer temperature-logging modules from eBay. These were recommended by lots of homebrewers on HomeBrewTalk as cheap and effective, although occasionally users reported large variances in temperatures and DOA sensors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/usbtemper.png" alt="The product ad" /></p>

<p>These are manufactured by PCsensor.com, which provides a linux command-line client to read the data of the thermometer.</p>

<p>I ordered three, and hooked them up to my brewery server.</p>

<p>###The First Hiccup###</p>

<p>The problem I encountered is that the pcsensor software was only designed to display one result at a time, and wasn’t configured for displaying multiple sensors. Luckily, I found <a href="http://momtchil.momtchev.com/node/6">a fork of the project that had been edited to allow that</a> by following <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.penguinsunbound.com/User:goeko/Temp_Sensor">this guide</a></p>

<p>Using <code>lsusb | grep TEMPer</code>, I was able to confirm that the computer was reading my sensors. I installed the pcsensor-multi software:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget http://momtchil.momtchev.com/files/pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
<span class="nb">tar</span> <span class="nt">-zxvf</span> pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
<span class="nb">cd </span>pcsensor-1.0.0
make</code></pre></figure>

<p><em>(note: a backed-up copy of the pcsensor program can be found <a href="/files/pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz">here</a>)</em></p>

<p>And moved it into /usr/bin/local.</p>

<p>###Logging Temperatures###</p>

<p>At this point, I could enter the pcsensor command and get output:</p>

<p>2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 65.19F 18.44C
2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 61.59F 16.44C</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t be around all day to check out the temperatures. I set up a cron job to write the temperatures to a log:</p>

        Homebrew Temperature Monitoring

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2013</span>

    <p>A few weeks ago, I embarked on a project to monitor the temperature of my homebrews as they ferment and bottle-age.</p>

<p>###The Data###</p>

<p>In order to record temperatures, I ordered 3 TEMPer temperature-logging modules from eBay. These were recommended by lots of homebrewers on HomeBrewTalk as cheap and effective, although occasionally users reported large variances in temperatures and DOA sensors.</p>

<p><img src="//images/usbtemper.png" alt="The product ad" /></p>

<p>These are manufactured by PCsensor.com, which provides a linux command-line client to read the data of the thermometer.</p>

<p>I ordered three, and hooked them up to my brewery server.</p>

<p>###The First Hiccup###</p>

<p>The problem I encountered is that the pcsensor software was only designed to display one result at a time, and wasn’t configured for displaying multiple sensors. Luckily, I found a fork of the project that had been edited to allow that: http://momtchil.momtchev.com/node/6. Here’s a good guide I followed: http://www.penguinsunbound.com/User:goeko/Temp_Sensor</p>

<p>Using <code>lsusb | grep TEMPer</code>, I was able to confirm that the computer was reading my sensors. I installed the pcsensor-multi software:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">wget http://momtchil.momtchev.com/files/pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
<span class="nb">tar</span> <span class="nt">-zxvf</span> pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
<span class="nb">cd </span>pcsensor-1.0.0
make</code></pre></figure>

<p>And moved it into /usr/bin/local.</p>

<p>###Logging Temperatures###</p>

<p>At this point, I could enter the pcsensor command and get output:</p>

<p>2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 65.19F 18.44C
2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 61.59F 16.44C</p>

<p>But I wouldn’t be around all day to check out the temperatures. I set up a cron job to write the temperatures to a log:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"># m h dom mon dow command
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/pcsensor &gt;&gt; /home/fred/temperatures.log</code></pre></figure>

<p>This reads as: ALL minutes (m) of ALL hours (h) of ALL days of the month on ALL days of the week, run the pcsensor program and add the output to the file “temperatures.log”.
So, every minute, the server adds temperature data to the log.</p>

<p>###Graphing the Data###</p>

<p>The Penguins Unbound link uses gnuplot to graph the data, an approach that I might take up in the future. However, I wanted to use the Google Charts API to generate my graphs.</p>

<p>Since the temperature sensors work as USB Human Input devices.</p>
