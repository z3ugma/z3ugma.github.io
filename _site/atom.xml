   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The drive to Acorn is unreal compared to other neighborhoods in Denver. Living in Englewood, I get a gradual shift to downtown - suburbs give way to rows of old bungalows, youthful hipster neighborhoods, then sports stadiums and high-rise apartments relective of the explosive urban growth experienced by Denver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drive from the north is diametrically different. Rolling foothills of wide-open prairiegrass are replaced by an ecstasy of interchanges, industrial buildings, train bridges, and warehouses. This is a gritter side of Denver, and feels very much like the Flats in my hometown of Cleveland. The conglomeration of skyscrapers in Denver push right up against this part of town, giving a feeling much like that of the Emerald City, like the buildings pushed up out of the ground, rainforest trees escaping a seedier understory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is River North - RiNo - and it&amp;#39;s becoming one of my favorite neighborhoods here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling into The Source, which is as far as I can gather a market / coworking / shared business space for all things hipster and gentrified, I park in a dirt lot after driving down a street whose shoulders are also paved with dirt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acorn occupies a grafittied exposed-brick and corrugated-steel enclave of the building with an open front and patio. The countertops and seating are polished, refined matte black and the waitstaff and bartenders mirror the image. The menu is tapas-style, and worth the price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fried Pickles with Green Goddess Aioli&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not overdone. A good intro, but nothing to write home about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House-Made Gnocchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am raving about these. The creme sauce is amazing - rich, thick, and seasoned perfectly with big, tangy salt flakes, it reminds me of clam chowder. Sharing the sauce are mushrooms bursting with flavor, smoky and tasting like they were roasted over the many logs of firewood stacked against the walls in here. These round out the clam portion of the chowder. The gnocchi are pan fried and starchy, completing the clam-chowder illusion. There&amp;#39;s something lemony there that I can&amp;#39;t quite place as well. Acorn has done very well on this dish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razor Clam Ceviche&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I needed a third dish to fill me, but the heavy fried food and cream sauce left me desiring something lighter, of which there wasn&amp;#39;t much that was also vegetarian.
The razor clam ceviche lacks the rich, briny flavor I usually seek in seafood. It&amp;#39;s good, and light, but that bright ocean clarity wasn&amp;#39;t around in my dish. It is, however, beautifully presented in a rigidly geometric arrangement, with straight and narrow razor clamshells at a rakish 45 degree offset from a square folded napkin, on which sits an ice bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cocktail bar is alright, but not on the caliber of Merchant in Madison or the Upstairs in Boulder. The company was decidely in my bracket though - lots of 30-something young professionals and tattooed well-to-do creatives. I&amp;#39;d recommend this restaurant to any struggling Denverite looking to go out with their parents, a troupe of acquaintances for after work, or the jetsetting, expense account (read: Epic) crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Sexy Pizza</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Sexy Pizza - South Pearl, Denver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a 5K sunset hike in Morrison, CO, today, a solid 20 minutes beyond surburban Denver and into the foothills. Afterwards, I was starving for an uncomplicated meal, and my friend Shauna has been after me to try Sexy Pizza for some time. It was right on the way home, so I stopped in. Pearl Street was unusually quiet so late at night, and I sat near the street in front of the wide-open garage door. An aside - it&amp;#39;s very awkward to walk into a restaurant that has a normal door adjacent to an open garage door. Which is the right entrance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was nice seeing all the passersby, and the service staff was, like the restaurant, uncomplicated. They let me walk into the back unannounced to get a box at the end of the meal, they didn&amp;#39;t bother me needlessly once my order was placed, and carried on lighthearted, boisterous conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t express the same happiness for their product. Thick dough goes into a very hot brick-style oven, and the bottom of the crust takes on a Neapolitan crisp. The top of the dough stayed pillowy, however, and it made for a weird texture - too crunchy on the bottom, but underdone near the toppings. I do confess I ordered a lot of watery toppings in the form of a veggie pie, but the weird duality of the texture turned me off. My goal for my time in Denver is to not eat dinner at the same place twice - here&amp;#39;s one I won&amp;#39;t regret not visiting again.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been wanting to do this for some time, and I think I&amp;#39;m taking the plunge - you&amp;#39;ll start seeing restaurant reviews on here as well as code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Four and Twenty, East Johnson, Madison&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start with, I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;ve never been here. Well, actually, it stands to reason - Four and Twenty stands in a tiny commercial space amid tightly-knit ranch houses and sandwiched between the thoroughfares of East Wash and Packers Ave, so it&amp;#39;s easy to drive right on past and not give it a second thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do so would be a mistake. Mel and I were on our way to an art fair in the neighborhood and she commented that her friend Phil sometimes works here. We were looking for something small and quick to eat, and Four and Twenty fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cafe is small with big windows out onto a soccer field and a concrete patio with planters - in summer it&amp;#39;s flooded with light, which illuminates all the imperfections (and the artwork) inside. The swinging doors to the kitchen don&amp;#39;t completely block its view, nor that of the supply room, giving it a just-moved in feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mel and I ordered breakfast sandwiches, and they were probably my ideal quick brunch if I could ever describe it. I had an egg and cheddar with spinach and sauteed mushrooms, on the second-best biscuit I&amp;#39;ve ever had (that honor goes to Third &amp;amp; Hollywood in Columbus). The biscuit was big and firm. It didn&amp;#39;t flake off in layers or crumble in little ball-bearings of dough - it held together and didn&amp;#39;t stick my tongue to the roof of my mouth. This biscuit is definitely something to write home about. A small cup of fruit accompanied the sandwich and made for a well-priced, well-portioned breakfast that didn&amp;#39;t make me want to nap afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also mention my drink, since it was even better than my sandwich - props to Phil. An iced chai latte with a rich milkiness that I&amp;#39;m often lacking. It was understated and sweet and I&amp;#39;d like to have another soon.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Homegrown Recipe App That Helps You Cook</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2015/01/16/a-homegrown-recipe-app-that-helps-you-cook/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-16T21:50:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2015/01/16/a-homegrown-recipe-app-that-helps-you-cook</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I do love to cook. All of my favorite recipes are stored in my head, are improvised off the cuff, or found in a gross stack of crinkled papers held together with a binder clip in my cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do a lot of looking up recipes online, but every recipe website I&amp;#39;ve seen has a big flaw. These sites are not designed to help you actually read the recipe. They are designed to keep you clicking around, keep you sharing recipes on social media, keep you seeing ads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted a recipe app that would just show me what I needed to gather and how to put it together to cook it all. In the meantime, I decided it wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt it if were also pretty to look at. Lastly, I wanted it optimized for use on an iPad so that I could keep it close at hand while actually cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3ugma/rethink-recipes/master/screenshot1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Finished Recipes Webapp&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Technical Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python is my pet language, and I wanted a database that would be easy to use with native Python types. Recipes are well-suited to a document-oriented store - each recipe has highly-variable ingredients. The only potential advantage I could see for a relational db would be to answer queries like &amp;quot;show me all the recipes with onion as an ingredient&amp;quot;. 
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rethinkdb.com&quot;&gt;RethinkDB&lt;/a&gt; is great because it has a native web interface and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rethinkdb.com/docs/introduction-to-reql/&quot;&gt;cool query language&lt;/a&gt; called ReQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Python and Flask to write the app, and Tornado to make it easy to deploy - I can never seem to get uWSGI or Gunicorn working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Frontend Design&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two design elements set Rethink Recipes apart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a recipe is entered, the app finds the top 8 Google Images hits for the title of the recipe. It uses the colors found in these images to calculate a &lt;strong&gt;unique, indivualized color palette&lt;/strong&gt; for each recipe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whenever an ingredient appears verbatim in the directions, it is &lt;strong&gt;highlighted&lt;/strong&gt; in the directions. This makes it easy to scan the directions for the step you should be on next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;App Routes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the nuts and bolts of how Rethink Recipes works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Adding a Recipe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/z3ugma/rethink-recipes/master/screenshot3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Adding a Recipe&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When accessing &lt;strong&gt;/add&lt;/strong&gt;, the user is presented with 3 form fields - the title, ingredients, and directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the form is submitted, a bunch of things happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The title of the recipe is joined with + signs. i.e. &amp;quot;Foo bar baz pancakes&amp;quot; -&amp;gt; &amp;quot;foo+bar+baz+pancakes&amp;quot;. This is the format the Google Images api receives queries in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Google Image API query returns a list of URLs pointing to Google Images thumbnails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Python module called Colorific, which uses PIL (the Python Image Library), extracts the most prominent colors from each image, 5 colors per image. (I also wrote my own module to do this processing, but Colorific was already packaged and easy to install. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;#39;re left with a list of RGB tuples. 5 colors per images times 8 images = 40 tuples long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Lightness value of each tuple is calculated (conversion to HSV color space), and the list is reordered in order of darkest to lightest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list is split into 4 smaller lists of 10 elements each. This roughly groups the colors into the 10 darkest, 10 next darkest, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The average value of the 10 RGB tuples in each list is calculated. We end up with 4 tuples to store to the db along with the recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The URL title is &amp;quot;slugified&amp;quot; - stripping out spaces and non alphanumeric punctuation to make a nice URL slug&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ingredients list is calculated. For each line in the ingredients box:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Split on spaces. The first 2 pieces are the amount - &amp;quot;1 cup&amp;quot; for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything after the amount is the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The directions list is each line of input in the dirctions box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All this data is formed into a Python dictionary:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Title, URLs of image thumbs, ingredients, directions, slug, and average colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ingredients and directions are sanitized for disallowed entries (like null string)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This Python dict is inserted into RethinkDB.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The user is redirected to the newly-created recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;get_gimages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;answer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/services/search/images?v=1.0&amp;amp;q=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;start=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;%d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;imgsz=large&amp;amp;imgtype=photo&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Editing a Recipe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same form from /add is rendered, with the data from the existing recipe filled in. Once the form is submitted, the same process as adding happens. Instead of inserting the new recipe, however, the existing recipe&amp;#39;s record is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slug of the recipe appears in the URL of the page. We use that slug to get the first recipe in the db that matches that slug. Note that there&amp;#39;s no guarantee of uniqueness for a slug - RethinkDB doesn&amp;#39;t have unique indexing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first recipe in the db with a matching slug is displayed. We take the &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; from each ingredient, and only take the portion before a comma. This allows for things like &amp;quot;onions, diced&amp;quot; to appear in the recipe, but still highlight the word &amp;quot;onions&amp;quot; in the directions. If the word appears in the directions, then the word in the directions is wrapped in kbd tags, which stand out in Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll recall that each recipe has 8 URLs of Google images and 4 RBG tuples of colors to use in displaying the page. When the page is rendered, the darkest of the RGB colors is used as the background of the header, the lightest is used for the page background and header text, and the 2nd darkest is used for the panel headers. The 4th one is reserved for future use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with the 8 Google images thumbnails in place, this makes each recipe page have the unique colors corresponding to the food you&amp;#39;re making! So a raspberry pie has bright reds and rich tans, and a chili recipe has lots of earthy tones.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;render_template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;recipes.html&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;urls&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;urls&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;avg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;rainbow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ingredients&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;ingredients&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;title&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;query&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end result of this is an iPad-optimized recipe database, customizable for your own personal recipes. Not great for importing directly from recipe sites, but great for saving your time-tested recipes in a user-friendly format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Futures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to expand this to being multi-user. I think each user would get their own RethinkDB table, and add a users table with hashed passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Check It Out&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can download and set it up for yourself in a virtual machine - see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/z3ugma/rethink-recipes&quot;&gt;Github repo for the project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also see my local copy of the app, at &lt;a href=&quot;http://z3ugma.zzzz.io:5025&quot;&gt;http://z3ugma.zzzz.io:5025&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to add your own recipes, but don&amp;#39;t delete mine :)&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Delicious Vegan Biscuits and Gravy</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2015/01/16/delicious-vegan-biscuits-and-gravy%20copy/"/>
   <updated>2015-01-16T16:50:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2015/01/16/delicious-vegan-biscuits-and-gravy copy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Next up, a departure from my usual programming entries to another hobby - cooking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.veganuary.com&quot;&gt;Veganuary&lt;/a&gt;! It&amp;#39;s a month of sacrifice for me, in the name of shedding holiday pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single hardest thing for me about going vegan is finding quick meals to make that aren&amp;#39;t a piece of fruit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s similar to when I stopped eating meat. At first, I started cooking the same old meals, just with the meat removed and a vegetable or mushrooms substituted. These sometimes felt lacking. Over time, I learned to cook &amp;quot;natively veggie&amp;quot; meals - meals that were vegetarian from the start, whose flavors melded and combined deliciously without the need for meat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;m not eating dairy or cheese, I find my usual meals lacking - because there&amp;#39;s no dairy or cheese. It will take some time to learn to cook &amp;quot;natively vegan&amp;quot;, I&amp;#39;m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, however, here&amp;#39;s an amazing, hearty, breakfast, that&amp;#39;s totally vegan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Vegan Biscuits and Gravy&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Serves 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;12 oz Trader Joe&amp;#39;s Soy Chorizo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 medium yellow onion, diced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 green bell pepper, diced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 oz Earth Balance buttery vegan spread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 oz whole wheat flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Tbsp Better than Bouillon No-Beef Base&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Garlic Naan or vegan english muffins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Directions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With a little olive oil, brown the chorizo, onions, and peppers in a large skillet. Once browned, move the mixture to one half of the pan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt the earth balance in the empty half of the pan. Add the flour and whisk lightly until a pasty consistency is achieved. Allow this roux to brown for a minute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mix bouillon and 1 cup of water. Add to the roux a little bit at a time, whisking constantly until gravy-like. Mix the chorizo mixture in with the broth. Add water to thin to your liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toast the garlic naan or english muffin. Slice into thin wafers and top the bread with biscuits and gravy. Yum!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title> LibUSB and Python to Overcome Bad USB Design</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/13/libusb-and-python-to-overcome-bad-usb-design/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-13T16:50:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/13/libusb-and-python-to-overcome-bad-usb-design</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://z3ugma.github.io/2013/10/25/homebrew-temperature-monitoring/&quot;&gt;Last October, I began recording temperatures&lt;/a&gt; for my homebrew setup. It used a C program called pcsensor that someone reverse-engineered from the Windows version available on the CD that came with my TEMPer1v1.4 sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem with these sensors is that they have no unique identifier - reading the value in from pcsensor with multiple sensors installed often resulted in the data series being mixed together, because there was no &amp;quot;order&amp;quot; to the way data was being read into the parser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a demonstration of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/graphinterference.png&quot; alt=&quot;Graph Interference&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the order of the orange and red points switch a lot? This made it really difficult to analyze the temperatures in my setup, apart from using a human to look at the trendline created by the mix of points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent some time trying to create a driver for these TEMPer sensors, but in the end I was able to find &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/padelt/temper-python&quot;&gt;one by Phillip Adelt that uses libusb and pyusb&lt;/a&gt; - libraries that allow you to talk to USB devices with Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/padelt/temper-python.git
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;temper-python
sudo python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ingenius thing that Phillip did was to determine the &lt;em&gt;port&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;bus&lt;/em&gt; of each sensor - thus giving it a &amp;quot;unique ID&amp;quot; based on where it was physically plugged into the computer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His module installs itself as &amp;quot;temperusb&amp;quot;, so I wrote a quick script to read the value of the sensors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# encoding: utf-8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;temperusb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TemperHandler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TemperHandler&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;devs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_devices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;enumerate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;devs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_temperature&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;fahrenheit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dev&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_bus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ports&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Linux limits which users can access raw USB data, so we either need to install some &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html#example-pilot&quot;&gt;udev rules&lt;/a&gt; or run the script as superuser. Sudo is easiest for me. It outputs something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;fred@brewery:~$ sudo python temper_read.py
[sudo] password for fred:
(2, 2, 56.8625)
(2, 1, 22.1)
fred@brewery:~$&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bus and port will be consistent, even if the &lt;em&gt;order&lt;/em&gt; of the entries gets switched. Now we can depend on the results of these sensors, and send them to InfluxDB:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# encoding: utf-8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;temperusb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;TemperHandler&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;json&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put this in the superuser&amp;#39;s crontab:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo crontab -e&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;# m h  dom mon dow   command
* * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/fred/temper_influx.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This sends the available temperatures to InfluxDB once a minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which leaves me very happy with my temperature-monitoring setup:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>InfluxDB Augments My Homebrew Temperature Monitor</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/13/influxdb-augments-my-homebrew-temperature-monitor/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-13T13:50:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/13/influxdb-augments-my-homebrew-temperature-monitor</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://z3ugma.github.io/2013/10/25/homebrew-temperature-monitoring/&quot;&gt;Last October, I began recording temperatures&lt;/a&gt; for my homebrew setup. It was early in my explorations of Python and scripting, and ran in a pretty silly fashion. It went something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Echo the output of a C program that read the temperatures into a log file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parse that logfile using python to create a JSON file for Google Charts to use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use PHP embedded in HTML via an AJAX callback function to parse that JSON file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display the result in Google Charts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was incredibly slow and process intensive when more than 1 week&amp;#39;s worth of data was captured, so I moved the log to a backup file weekly, leaving a blank file for the next week&amp;#39;s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://influxdb.com/&quot;&gt;InfluxDB&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/03/02/time-series-databases-influxdb/&quot;&gt;getting a lot of buzz&lt;/a&gt; on HackerNews lately. It is a time-series database, which means that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://influxdb.com/docs/v0.8/introduction/getting_started.html#writing-and-exploring-data-in-the-ui&quot;&gt;primary key&lt;/a&gt; of any entry is the timestamp of when the data was entered into the database. Queries are done using a SQL-like syntax, but everything is oriented around time. Queries like &amp;quot;give me the last data value of every hour&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;what is the average value of this data point for the past 3 Wednesdays&amp;quot; are difficult to do with large data sets in a traditional SQL database, but InfluxDB is designed from the ground up to handle them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a future idea - how to join time-series data from Influx to regular relational data in MySQL? This is relevant for another project I&amp;#39;m currently working on. Keep an eye out for updates on that project as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What won me over to databases like InfluxDB and &lt;a href=&quot;http://rethinkdb.com/&quot;&gt;RethinkDB&lt;/a&gt; is the simple, no-nonsense, easy-to-use web interface that comes ready right out of the box, and the SQL-like query language. Another big win for Influx was support from &lt;a href=&quot;http://grafana.org/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;, a turnkey open-source time-series graphing platform, which I highly encourage you to check out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I set up InfluxDB on a Vagrant VM on my Mac server, with the Vagrantfile like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# -*- mode: ruby -*-&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# vi: set ft=ruby :&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# encoding: utf-8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# Vagrantfile API/syntax version. Don&amp;#39;t touch unless you know what you&amp;#39;re doing!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Vagrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;configure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;do&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;box&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;hashicorp/precise64&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
 
 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;basename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Dir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getwd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hostname&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dirname&lt;/span&gt;

 &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;vm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;network&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;forwarded_port&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;guest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8083&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ss&quot;&gt;host&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8083&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This forwards the InfluxDB ports, port 80 for serving Grafana, installs influx, Grafana, and python dependencies, and sets up cron jobs (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With InfluxDB running, the first step was to capture some data! Since I bought a Nest themostat, I figured that would be a good piece of time-series data to measure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;nest_thermostat&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest_thermostat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;username&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;login&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;get_status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;shared&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;current_temperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;shared&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;target_temperature_type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;shared&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;nest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;target_temperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InfluxDBClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8086&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;temperatures&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;points&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;nest&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;columns&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;temperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;target_temperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;type&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running this every minute via cron pulls the current temperature as well as the target temperature (what the thermostat is set to) into InfluxDB, through its easy-to-use but peculiarly-structured API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did the same thing with &lt;a href=&quot;http://forecast.io/&quot;&gt;Forecast.io&lt;/a&gt;, my favorite weather API. This tells me the temperature outside my house:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;forecastio&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;#####################&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;43.05660&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lng&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;89.38337&lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forecast&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forecastio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;load_forecast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lng&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forecast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;hourly&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temperature&lt;/span&gt;


&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InfluxDBClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8086&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;temperatures&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;points&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;temp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;forecastio_lakeside&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;columns&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;temperature&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write_points&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This required me to get a Forecast.io API key, with a limit of 1000 calls per day. That&amp;#39;s why I call it once every 2 minutes, for 720 calls per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last part of setting up the VM is to perform database migrations - set up users and databases for the temperature data to go into:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#!/usr/bin/python&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;influxdb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;InfluxDBClient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;localhost&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;8086&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;root&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;create_database&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;grafana&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add_database_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;temperatures&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

   <title>Keeping VirtualBox and Vagrant Boxes Alive Through Reboots</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/10/keeping-virtualbox-and-vagrant-boxes-alive-through-reboots/"/>
   <updated>2014-12-10T11:50:55-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/12/10/keeping-virtualbox-and-vagrant-boxes-alive-through-reboots</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently switched from a dedicated Windows 7 PC for my home server to a Mac Mini, mostly for the better electricity consumption and the fact the the PC was having nightly bluescreen crashes and restarting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been a fan of RDP, and my office uses PCs - so to keep the convenient RDP access to home, I installed &lt;a href=&quot;www.virtualbox.org&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; and created a Windows VM. This has a bridged network adapter, so it just looks like another computer on my home network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, when Mac OS restarts, or after a power failure, the virtual machine is powered off. This won&amp;#39;t do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Daemons in Mac OS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac OS has the usual suspects like cron, but has a neat daemon launching system, appropriately called &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html&quot;&gt;launchd&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in 10.4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launchd works by &amp;quot;loading&amp;quot; (think of it like a soft-install) objects called &amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;plist&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;. Plist is a serialized object format like JSON or XML that tells launchd the properties of how to execute a particular daemon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to play with creating your own plists, head over to &lt;a href=&quot;http://launched.zerowidth.com&quot;&gt;http://launched.zerowidth.com&lt;/a&gt;, where Nathan Witmer has created a plist generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Automatic Tasks in VirtualBox&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VirtualBox comes with a command-line interface to automate tasks on VMs. My need is simple - just boot the box:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;VBoxHeadless -s Windows -v on&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows the syntax for VBoxHeadless:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;-s, -startvm, --startvm &amp;lt;name|uuid&amp;gt;   Start given VM (required argument)
  -v, -vrde, --vrde on|off|config       Enable (default) or disable the VRDE server or don&amp;#39;t change the setting&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VRDE is the Virtual Remote Desktop extension, which allows RDP out of the box through a special Oracle tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Booting my VM at Login&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;launchd has multiple &amp;quot;runlevels&amp;quot; - there are System level daemons, and daemons for whenever a given user logs in. User daemons are stored at ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the help of the launched tool, I made a plist for my command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;UTF-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &amp;quot;-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;plist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;version=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;KeepAlive&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;true/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Label&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;io.zzzz.z3ugma.launched.windowsvirtualbox&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;VBoxHeadless&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;-s&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Windows&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;-v&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;on&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/array&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;true/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;UserName&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;fred&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Users/fred&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;StandardErrorPath&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Users/fred/windowsvm.log&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;StandardOutPath&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/key&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Users/fred/windowsvm.log&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/string&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/dict&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/plist&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notable options in here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KeepAlive = True&lt;/strong&gt; - If the VBoxHeadless process crashes for some reason, or someone manually shuts down the box (perhap from within RDP), the box restarts itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RunAtLoad = True&lt;/strong&gt; - Run this daemon when the daemon is loaded. &amp;quot;Loading&amp;quot; occurs at login, and when a user manually loads the daemon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WorkingDirectory&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;UserName&lt;/strong&gt; - These are special directives needed because of the peculiar way that VirtualBox runs. Just set it to the home folder of the user running the daemon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This xml is saved into a file in /Library/LaunchAgents. Navigate to that directory, and execute&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;launchctl load &amp;lt;name of plist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;launchctl&lt;/em&gt; is the program that Mac OS uses to control launchd processes. Once the plist has been loaded, it should persist after reboot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar plist can be used for the command &amp;#39;vagrant up&amp;#39; to launch vagrant vms.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Find all the casks</title>
   <link href="http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/05/01/Find-all-the-casks/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-01T09:50:55-06:00</updated>
   <id>http://z3ugma.github.io/2014/05/01/Find-all-the-casks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a great package manager for Mac called Homebrew that acts sort of like Aptitude on Ubuntu; it makes it really easy to quickly install software for your Mac from the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Casks platform is built on top of Homebrew - it allows you to install your commonly-used desktop apps for Mac. This makes writing a setup script for when you reformat easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes Casks a great place to explore to find new Mac software you didn&amp;#39;t know existed. Unfortunately, the most you can see from the Casks master list on Github is the name of the software - you have to go into each .rb to find the URL for the website of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a quick and dirty script to go through all of these Casks and make a text file that I can put in Excel to open all the websites at once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we download all the files in the github repo to our target folder, then we run:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listdir&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os.path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mypath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;/path/to/target/folder&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onlyfiles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;listdir&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mypath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;isfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mypath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onlyfiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;casks.txt&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;wb&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Using Python to Pay Parking Tickets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An enterprising fellow from Milwaukee built a site to automatically pay parking tickets in his city and in Madison. Unfortunately, the city of Madison changed around their ticket-payment website, so the site is not working. I thought it would be a good programing challenge for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How Do You Work with Web Services When They Have No API?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the City of Madison doesn&amp;#39;t have an API on their website, it&amp;#39;s not a simple matter of sending a query and getting back a nicely-formatted JSON response to use in my app. So how can I get the information that I need from the website? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, all websites have at least one available point of entry - via the web, as a user! There&amp;#39;s a Python package to emulate user behavior in a browser and return the HTTP response, which we can further manipulate as we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;a href=&quot;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mechanize/&quot;&gt;Mechanize&lt;/a&gt;, originally developed for Perl. I install the Python package and make a script to go to the City of Madison&amp;#39;s parking ticket payment site at https://www.cityofmadison.com/epayment/parkingTicket/. I based this on an example at http://stockrt.github.io/p/emulating-a-browser-in-python-with-mechanize/.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;mechanize&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;cookielib&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Browser&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mechanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Cookie Jar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cookielib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;LWPCookieJar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_cookiejar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Browser options&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_handle_equiv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_handle_redirect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_handle_referer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_handle_robots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;bp&quot;&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Follows refresh 0 but not hangs on refresh &amp;gt; 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;set_handle_refresh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mechanize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;HTTPRefreshProcessor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;max_time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Want debugging messages?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#br.set_debug_http(True)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#br.set_debug_redirects(True)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#br.set_debug_responses(True)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# User-Agent (this is cheating, ok?)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addheaders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;User-agent&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; en-US; rv:1.9.0.1) Gecko/2008071615 Fedora/3.0.1-1.fc9 Firefox/3.0.1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Open some site, let&amp;#39;s pick a random one, the first that pops in mind:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;https://www.cityofmadison.com/epayment/parkingTicket/search.cfm&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Show the source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#print html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This returns us the html of the city&amp;#39;s parking ticket page as a big string of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/msnticket/1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Searching for Tickets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to search for a parking ticket, it looks like I need to first accept the terms and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Mechanize is &amp;#39;stateful&amp;#39; - it acts like a browser tab that a user would have open - I can submit this form and continue working with my browser class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we do that, here are some other things you can do with Mechanize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Show the source&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#print html&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Show the html title&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Show the response headers&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# or&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Show the available forms&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the main objective. We need to first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the form on the page with the checkbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the checkbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit the form to continue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#fet First hurdle: Accepting the terms. Here we find a form, click a checkbox, and submit the form to load the next page into mechanize&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;select_form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;termsAcceptance&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;acceptTerms&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;1&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, I needed to find the name of the form and the checkbox control. I used Chrome Developer tools to inspect it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/msnticket/2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/msnticket/3.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we follow that action in our simulated browser and are brought to the Search page:
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/msnticket/4.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great news! This is where we can enter our first dynamic input - a license plate to test. I do a similar inspection and find the names of the form and controls I need to manipulate:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;select_form&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;plateSearch&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Plate&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;123ABC&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;State&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;WI&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;find_control&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;VehTyp&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;value&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;PC&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;submit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;br&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#fet For inspection, we can write the text of the page that loads to a file&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;msnticketresponse.html&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;wb&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;write&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;close&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what the HTML of the search returns for a plate with existing tickets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/msnticket/5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Manipulating the HTML Search Results to Work With Them in Python&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to take the HTML output and parse the page. The problem is that the output is not always regular. We need something like regular expressions that will let us recognize certain, sometimes repeated parts of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://lxml.de/&quot;&gt;LXML&lt;/a&gt; library is a good starting place to process XML and HTML in Python. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ll also take advantage of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/&quot;&gt;XPATH, which is like regex for XML&lt;/a&gt;:
Let&amp;#39;s inspect the HTML of the search results to find what is regular about these ticket results.

                            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;align=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;center&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;margin-top: 8px;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;input&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;submit&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;ticketPayments&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;value=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Continue&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/form&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

                &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!-- InstanceEndEditable --&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/table&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that each discrete piece of data about each ticket is contained in a table cell &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;td&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and that each of these is the child of a &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that stands for each ticket. To get each ticket, we&amp;#39;ll figure out what is common to those &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each is the direct child of a form. Since there&amp;#39;s only one form on the page, we can start there. Note that XPATH requires some strict syntax and won&amp;#39;t necessarily follow the design of your element nesting here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the XPATH syntax that finally worked to return each ticket and nothing else:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tickets&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tree&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;//form/table/tr[position()&amp;gt;2]//td//text()&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how we read this, from right to left:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//text()

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two slashes: &lt;em&gt;Select ALL of&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;text() - Select the text inside this element (as opposed to the class, or the href, or another attribute)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//td - Select ALL &lt;td&gt; elements (even if they&amp;#39;re not the direct child)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;/tr[position()&amp;gt;2] - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp&quot;&gt;This is the complicated one&lt;/a&gt;. Select &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s that are the direct children of the parent (one slash). Only select &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s that are the 3rd or greater &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; child of their parent. This is to accommodate for these two &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s in our page that come before the tickets:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-html&quot; data-lang=&quot;html&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;colspan=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;7&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;RequiredLabel&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(* indicates required field)&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;tr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;backgroundMedium&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;td&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Heading14Bold&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;width=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;12%&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Ticket No&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/td&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/tr&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;//form/table - Select tables that are the direct children of ALL forms on the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This give us (semi) nice lists like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of garbage in there, like carriage returns, tabs, and spaces. Additionally, we&amp;#39;re only interested in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of the list elements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Strip out extra spaces, newlines, tabs. &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Take the new tickets list and pop the next 9 values. Iterate until the list is too small to possibly contain a ticket (less than 4 elements long)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;print&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from the neatly printed output, we also now have a dictionary of tickets. We&amp;#39;ve achieved the goal of a fake &amp;#39;API&amp;#39; for searching for parking tickets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for actually &lt;em&gt;paying&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Part 2: Getting the Python EWS Client to Send an Email&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;#39;ve got a client connect to the Exchange server, I can actually use the SOAP API methods as documented in the WSDL and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa580675.aspx&quot;&gt;Microsoft&amp;#39;s documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suds has great built-in methods and classes for working with SOAP, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/suds/2010-July/001029.html&quot;&gt;as this post confirms&lt;/a&gt;, bugs in both Suds and EWS mean that I&amp;#39;ll have to manually build the XML and inject it directly into the message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I have code that will  connect a Suds client to my exchange server and send an XML message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;ewsclient&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Changes to Suds to make it EWS compliant&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;ewsclient.monkey&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# More Suds changes&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.transport.https&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WindowsHttpAuthenticated&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Uncomment below to turn on logging&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Logging on/accessing EWS SOAP API&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;exchange server&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;r&amp;#39;DOMAIN\username&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;password&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transport&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WindowsHttpAuthenticated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;suds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/EWS/Services.wsdl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;transport&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ewsclient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Now that the SOAP client is connected to EWS, send this XML soap message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;CreateItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;__inject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;msg&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we just need to tell it what to send in that message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Building the XML Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are all kinds of things you can talk to EWS about, but I just want to talk about emails.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/aa566468.aspx&quot;&gt;template message from Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and changed a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First,  I wanted to place a copy in my SentItems folder, so I added&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;SavedItemFolderId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:DistinguishedFolderId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;sentitems&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/SavedItemFolderId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first iteration, I had the body sent as text but I wanted to replace it with an HTML email template to make it prettier. This was tough for me to figure out; I kept getting XML validation errors. Eventually, I learned about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_cdata.asp&quot;&gt;CDATA&lt;/a&gt;, a tag that tells the XML parser to ignore whatever&amp;#39;s inside it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I replaced the Body tag with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:Body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;BodyType=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[#Body#]]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:Body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And will replace the #Body# with some HTML from an email template later.
Lastly, I put in some information about an automatic Reminder to get the final message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-xml&quot; data-lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;soap:Envelope&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns:soap=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns:t=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/types&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;soap:Body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;CreateItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;MessageDisposition=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;SendAndSaveCopy&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;xmlns=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/exchange/services/2006/messages&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;SavedItemFolderId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:DistinguishedFolderId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;Id=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;sentitems&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/SavedItemFolderId&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Items&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:Message&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:ItemClass&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;IPM.Note&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:ItemClass&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:Subject&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;Python EWS Bot #SubjectDate#&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:Subject&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:Body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;BodyType=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;HTML&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;cp&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;![CDATA[#Body#]]&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:Body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:ReminderDueBy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;#ReminderDate#T11:00:00-06:00&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:ReminderDueBy&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:ReminderIsSet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:ReminderIsSet&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:ReminderMinutesBeforeStart&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;180&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:ReminderMinutesBeforeStart&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:ToRecipients&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:Mailbox&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
              &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:EmailAddress&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;email@domain.com&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:EmailAddress&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:Mailbox&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:ToRecipients&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;t:IsRead&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;false&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:IsRead&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/t:Message&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/Items&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/CreateItem&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/soap:Body&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/soap:Envelope&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of those #Variable# tags I put in the XML will be string-replaced on the Python side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Putting Variables into the Message&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote a quick little function to take a list of tuples and a template text and replace the text in the template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Replacing the text in the XML SOAP message&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xmlreplace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;ow&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;text&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Make a string out of the current time&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;curdatetime&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;strftime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;%c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Set the Reminder Date for one week from today&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reminderday&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;today&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;datetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;timedelta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;days&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#Open an HTML file to use as the body&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;r&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;read&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#List of parameters in the XML to replace: (template, replacement).&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xmlparams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#SubjectDate#&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;curdatetime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#Body#&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;#ReminderDate#&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;reminderday&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Replace everything in the XML template shown above with the new dynamic values&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xmlreplace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xmltemplate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;xmlparams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have XML as a big string, I can send my message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/pythonewsemail.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/exchangedev/archive/2009/02/05/quick-and-dirty-unix-shell-scripting-with-ews.aspx&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, I learned how to write a little shell script that uses cURL to check to see if I&amp;#39;m connecting to the Exchange Web Services server correctly. This made testing my Python EWS script easier, especially when I accidentally connected to the wrong WiFi network and couldn&amp;#39;t contact the EWS server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;curl -u username@domain:password -L https://exchange_server/ews/exchange.asmx -H &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Content-Type:text/xml&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;    --ntlm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will read back the schema from the WSDL file if you&amp;#39;ve successfully connected to the server.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Creating an Internal Emailing Wikibot in Python&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know how they say that when all you have is a hammer that everything looks like a nail?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Python is my hammer. I understand that C# or VB would be a better choice for this project, particularly since Microsoft Exchange plays much more nicely with them than Python, but as I&amp;#39;m just starting out I think I&amp;#39;m still in the phase of learning  &lt;em&gt;how the language works&lt;/em&gt;, and haven&amp;#39;t quite progressed to learning &lt;em&gt;what the language is good for&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose there&amp;#39;s something to be said for the fact that Python is platform-agnostic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s a project I&amp;#39;m working on, though: the first end-goal is to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.)   Find a random wiki page
2.)   Find its owner
3.)   Email that owner to notify them that page was chosen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part 1: Connecting Python to Exchange Web Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this is an internal wiki to my company, there is a lot of benefit to using Exchange to send the emails. Most of all that I am rolling it on my own, and not working with the network admins and therefore don&amp;#39;t have access to the SMTP server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server has a SOAP API, called Exchange Web Services. This has been a fun experience learning SOAP for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What is SOAP?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOAP stands for Simple Object Access protocol. It&amp;#39;s an XML-based messaging system that servers and clients can use to talk to each other with standardized messages.  The client understand what XML tags the server uses by getting a file called the WSDL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be using a Python SOAP library called Suds  to talk to the Exchange server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few catches, though. EWS doesn’t play nice with Suds, so we need a few patches and other modules to get it working well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Installing Suds&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Mac and Linux, this is trivially easy: run &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;sudo pip install suds&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you don’t have pip on your Mac, you can run &lt;a href=&quot;https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py&quot;&gt;the get-pip&lt;/a&gt; installer file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Windows, where I did it, this is a little harder, but you can still download an easy_install script and the zip file of Suds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, you boot up a SOAP client with Suds, and I didn&amp;#39;t document this very well, but it returns an HTTP 401 error; Not Authorized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Getting Suds to Work with EWS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm. Googling for a few hours brought me to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mail.libexpat.org/pipermail/soap/2011-September/000583.html&quot;&gt;good solution, first suggested on the Suds forums&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EWSClient is Daniel Holth&amp;#39;s solution to marrying Suds to EWS.  Installing it will also intall python-ntlm, which will be important later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main file in EWSClient is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.plugin&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This adds a plugin to Suds that adds EWS&amp;#39;s definitions to the end of the SOAP request. I don&amp;#39;t quite understand how it works, given Microsoft&amp;#39;s byzantine EWS definitions. At any rate, it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EWSClient has a few other files, too, like monkey.py, which fixes an issue where the client makes a request to the often-overloaded W3C definitions for XML. It instead lets you access a locally-cached copy of the file. I disabled it because my Windows python client was causing me a headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the example files that ewsclient provides, I try to get the WSDL specs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-python&quot; data-lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;ewsclient&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;os&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.client&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;suds.transport.https&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WindowsHttpAuthenticated&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kn&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;logging&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;#logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;test_basic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;suds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Client&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;https://&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;/EWS/Services.wsdl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;domain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ewsclient&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;AddService&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()])&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing to focus on is that we&amp;#39;re authenticating with NTLM, and the auth&lt;em&gt;header&lt;/em&gt;value s aren&amp;#39;t formatted properly. There are some issues in python-ntlm that need fixing to play nicely with the encoding of domain, user, and pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Fixing NTLM to Work with our Suds Client&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.google.com/p/python-ntlm/issues/detail?id=17&quot;&gt;There&amp;#39;s an issue documented at the python-ntm page&lt;/a&gt;. The solution in post #3, in which we add a few lines to the code of /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/ntlm/HTTPNtlmAuthHandler.py (on my Mac, your filepath will be different), worked for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these changes, made, testing authorization works and I&amp;#39;m ready to start doing things with my client.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h2&gt;A First Toast&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By which, I clearly meant post. I&amp;#39;m now using GitHub pages to serve my blog. Before, it was on a Wordpress site hosted on a laptop in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using a theme engine called &lt;em&gt;Octopress&lt;/em&gt;. There&amp;#39;s a link in the footer. It&amp;#39;s a neat little static site generator. Posts are created in markdown (something else I&amp;#39;m trying for the first time), and a ruby Rake (still not sure what that means) file takes the markdown, along with the theme&amp;#39;s SASS, and generates a static site which is committed to the GitHub pages repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent about 30 minutes installing and configuring Octopress, and another 2 hours trying to figure out how themes work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://z3ugma.github.io&quot;&gt;Example link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List element 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;ll be keeping track of the fun stuff I come across while learning (mostly) Python and other programming.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I embarked on a project to monitor the temperature of my homebrews as they ferment and bottle-age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to record temperatures, I ordered 3 TEMPer temperature-logging modules from eBay. These were recommended by lots of homebrewers on HomeBrewTalk as cheap and effective, although occasionally users reported large variances in temperatures and DOA sensors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/usbtemper.png&quot; alt=&quot;The product ad&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are manufactured by PCsensor.com, which provides a linux command-line client to read the data of the thermometer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ordered three, and hooked them up to my brewery server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The First Hiccup&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem I encountered is that the pcsensor software was only designed to display one result at a time, and wasn&amp;#39;t configured for displaying multiple sensors. Luckily, I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://momtchil.momtchev.com/node/6&quot;&gt;a fork of the project that had been edited to allow that&lt;/a&gt; by following &lt;a href=&quot;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.penguinsunbound.com/User:goeko/Temp_Sensor&quot;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using lsusb | grep TEMPer, I was able to confirm that the computer was reading my sensors. I installed the pcsensor-multi software:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;wget http://momtchil.momtchev.com/files/pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
tar -zxvf pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz
&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;pcsensor-1.0.0
make&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(note: a backed-up copy of the pcsensor program can be found &lt;a href=&quot;/files/pcsensor-1.0.0-multi.tgz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And moved it into /usr/bin/local.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Logging Temperatures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I could enter the pcsensor command and get output:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 65.19F 18.44C
2011/12/08 14:09:16 Temperature 61.59F 16.44C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I wouldn&amp;#39;t be around all day to check out the temperatures. I set up a cron job to write the temperatures to a log:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;# m h dom mon dow command
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/pcsensor &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /home/fred/temperatures.log&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reads as: ALL minutes (m) of ALL hours (h) of ALL days of the month on ALL days of the week, run the pcsensor program and add the output to the file &amp;quot;temperatures.log&amp;quot;.
So, every minute, the server adds temperature data to the log.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Graphing the Data&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/googlechart.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Google Chart graph&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Penguins Unbound link uses gnuplot to graph the data, an approach that I might take up in the future. However, I wanted to use the Google Charts API to generate my graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be continued: the exciting saga of why you don&amp;#39;t try to parse thousands of lines of text as a time-series database.&lt;/p&gt;
